//! Provides a reasonably concurrent zero-copy ring-buffer with zero-cost multiple consumers, with the following characteristics:
//!   1) Zero-cost multiple & independent consumers are allowed -- like in a queue topic: each one will consume all the events;
//!   2) The same consumer may still be shared by several threads -- like in a normal queue: every thread will receive a unique event;
//!   3) Each consumer holds their own state (their 'head' pointer), therefore access should be done through a special structure [RingBufferConsumer]
//!   4) Due to (1), any buffer overflows happens silently in the producer, when enqueueing -- overflows are only detectable when dequeueing.
//!      Please see more on [RingBufferConsumer] docs;
//!
//! Note: the commented out code on this module is a failed attempt to make this class generic, but Rust 1.54 seems, unfortunately,
//!       to be still incomplete regarding this area (generics & const fn's)
